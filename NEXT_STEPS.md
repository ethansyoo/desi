# Next Steps & Project Improvements

Here is a list of suggested improvements for the chatDESI project, categorized by priority and difficulty.

### Tier 1: Easy & Urgent

These are high-impact improvements that can be implemented quickly.

* **UI Feedback for Document Processing:** When an admin uploads a new PDF, the UI should provide more detailed feedback (e.g., "Processing document: `xyz.pdf`...", "Chunking text...", "Generating embeddings..."). This makes the system feel more responsive.
* **Refine Similarity Threshold:** The `rerank_and_fallback` method in `pdf_manager.py` uses a hardcoded `similarity_threshold` of 0.7. This should be made configurable (perhaps in `settings.py`) to allow for easier tuning.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** When a database connection fails or an API key is invalid, provide more user-friendly error messages with clear, actionable advice.
* **Display Document Count:** In the sidebar, show the total number of documents currently available in the database to give users a better sense of the knowledge base.

### Tier 2: Medium Difficulty / High Value

These improvements require more effort but will significantly enhance the application's capabilities.

* **True Hybrid Search:** The current fallback logic is a good start, but a more advanced implementation would use a single, powerful hybrid search query in MongoDB that combines keyword, vector, and filter clauses. This would improve the relevance of search results for complex queries.
* **User Authentication:** Implement a proper user login system (e.g., using a simple database of users or an authentication provider). This would allow you to manage access more securely and could be a foundation for user-specific chat histories.
* **Metadata Management:** Allow admins to view and edit metadata associated with each document (e.g., add tags, categories, or a short description). This metadata could then be used to further improve search filtering.
* **Conversational Memory:** The current implementation looks back at the last 6 messages. For more complex conversations, a more sophisticated memory management system (e.g., summarizing the conversation history) could be beneficial.

### Tier 3: Harder / Long-Term Vision

These are more ambitious features that would turn chatDESI into a truly next-generation research tool.

* **Automated Feedback Loop:** Implement a system where user feedback (the "helpful" / "not helpful" buttons) is used to fine-tune the retrieval model or the language model's responses over time. This is a complex but powerful way to improve the system's accuracy.
* **Multi-Document Comparison:** Add a feature that allows users to ask questions across multiple documents (e.g., "Compare the methodologies in `Paper_A.pdf` and `Paper_B.pdf`"). This would require more advanced context management.
* **Integration with External APIs:** Allow the chatbot to connect to external scientific databases (like ADS or arXiv) to fetch metadata or even full papers that are not yet in its local database.
* **Agentic Behavior:** Develop the chatbot into a more autonomous agent that can perform multi-step tasks. For example, a user could ask it to "find three papers on gravitational waves, summarize them, and highlight the key differences."
